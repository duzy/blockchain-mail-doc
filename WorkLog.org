#+BEGIN_ABSTRACT
\small\footnotesize
This =WorkLog.pdf= file is tending to log daily tasks performed. The schedule and
plan is arranged in the file =WorkPlan.pdf=. Note that items are marked according to
the statuses, e.g. \textsl{already done} (\textcolor{red}{$\boxtimes$}), \textsl{partially done}
(\textcolor{red}{$\boxminus$}), \textsl{planned but nothing done} (\textcolor{red}{$\square$}).
Item text in \ON{yellow color} denotes the active status (under development).
